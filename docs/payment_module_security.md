Payment Module Security (Stripe) â€” Detailed Guidance

Purpose
This document describes the security considerations, configuration, and operational controls required to run the Stripe-based payment module safely in production.

1. Secrets and key management
- Use a secrets manager (e.g., environment variables with restricted access in your hosting platform, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, or similar) to store STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET.
- Keep publishable key (NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY) public in the frontend only; never expose secret keys client-side.
- Use separate keys for development, staging, and production. Implement a key rotation schedule and maintain an access control list for who can view or rotate keys.

2. Webhook security
- Always verify the signature of incoming webhooks. Use the stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(rawBody, sigHeader, webhookSecret) flow provided by Stripe for your backend language to ensure the event was sent by Stripe.
- Preserve the raw request body for signature verification. In NestJS, ensure the webhook route bypasses body-parsing middleware or captures the raw body (check server framework docs).
- Record received Stripe event IDs and store them to prevent processing the same webhook multiple times (idempotent processing).
- Return the correct HTTP status codes: 2xx for successful processing; 4xx/5xx for failures that should be retried according to Stripe docs.

3. Transport security
- Require HTTPS on PUBLIC_ORIGIN and API endpoints accessible from the frontend.
- Enforce HSTS and use modern TLS configuration (TLS 1.2+).
- Use a reverse proxy or API gateway to terminate TLS and add additional protections (rate limiting, WAF rules).

4. Input validation and sanitization
- Validate all inputs on the server side: request bodies, query parameters, and path params.
- Use a schema validation library (Zod, Joi, or class-validator) and reject any unexpected fields.
- Sanitize any data that might be rendered in admin UIs to avoid stored XSS.

5. Idempotency and transactional handling
- Use Stripe idempotency keys for API calls that create charges or mutate critical external state.
- For webhook processing, persist the Stripe event.id and mark it as processed. If the same event arrives again, acknowledge without re-applying state changes.

6. Monitoring, logging, and alerting
- Centralize logs and mask or avoid logging sensitive data (no secret keys, no full card data).
- Integrate Sentry for exception tracking and create dashboards for payment success/failure rates.
- Add alerts for high webhook retry counts, repeated failed charges, or spikes in declined payments.

7. Operational readiness and runbooks
- Create a runbook for payment incidents describing steps to verify webhook signatures, reconcile orders, and manually trigger order fulfillment when necessary.
- Document the process to rotate keys and update deployed configuration.

8. Testing and pre-release checks
- Test the full flow in Stripe test mode. Use the Stripe CLI to forward webhook events to local or staging environments to validate signature verification and retry behaviors.
- Add automated checks to CI: dependency vulnerability scans, SAST (Semgrep), and unit/integration tests covering webhook processing.

9. PCI considerations
- Using Stripe Checkout significantly reduces PCI requirements since card data is handled by Stripe. Still, document your remaining responsibilities and consult Stripe for your classification.

10. Compliance and privacy
- Mask PII in logs and implement retention policies for payment data.
- Ensure data deletion/retention flows match legal/regulatory requirements in your jurisdictions (GDPR, CCPA).

11. Recommended integrations and tools
- Secrets manager (AWS/GCP/Platform-specific)
- Monitoring: Sentry, Prometheus, Grafana
- Security scanning: Semgrep, npm audit/Snyk
- WAF/API Gateway: Cloudflare, AWS WAF, or platform-provided gateway

12. Quick checklist for deploy to production
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET configured and verified in webhook handler
- HTTPS and HSTS enabled on frontend and API
- CORS restricted to expected origins
- Rate limiting and WAF rules applied
- Sentry (or equivalent) configured for error reporting
- CI security scans pass or are addressed

If you want, I can implement: webhook signature verification, idempotent processing (store processed event IDs), add rate-limiting middleware, or integrate Sentry. Specify which task to start with and I will proceed.
