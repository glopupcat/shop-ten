Payment Module Security Checklist

Purpose
This checklist captures essential security controls and configuration items required to safely operate the Stripe payment integration in production.

Core controls
- Environment & secrets
  - Store STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, and any other secrets in a secrets manager or environment variables; never commit them to git.
  - Ensure production and staging use separate keys.
  - Implement key rotation policy and audit who can access keys.

- Transport & network
  - Enforce HTTPS for all endpoints (redirect HTTP -> HTTPS) and enable HSTS.
  - Use TLS 1.2+ and disable weak ciphers.
  - Consider a WAF or API gateway in front of payment endpoints.

- Authentication & authorization
  - Ensure admin endpoints that view payment/order data are protected with strong auth (MFA) and role-based access control.
  - Limit which internal services can call sensitive endpoints.

- Webhook security
  - Verify Stripe webhook signatures on every incoming webhook using STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET and the Stripe SDK.
  - Implement idempotency for webhook processing to avoid duplicate state transitions.
  - Log raw webhook payloads to a secure, access-controlled store for audit (do not log secrets).

- Input validation & data handling
  - Validate and sanitize all incoming data (order IDs, metadata) before persisting or rendering.
  - Use strict schema validation on payloads (e.g., Zod, Joi, or class-validator) and reject unexpected fields.

- PCI/Payment considerations
  - Use Stripe Checkout or Elements to minimize PCI scope; never store raw card data.
  - Review Stripe docs for PCI responsibilities and ensure compliance for your business model.

- Operational security
  - Implement rate limiting for endpoints that create sessions or accept webhooks.
  - Add monitoring, tracing, and centralized logs (Sentry, Prometheus, Grafana).
  - Create alerting for repeated webhook failures, high retry rates, or large volumes of failed payments.

- Privacy & data retention
  - Mask or avoid storing PII in logs.
  - Implement a retention policy for payment records and related logs.
  - Ensure compliance with local privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) as applicable.

- Dependency and code security
  - Run dependency vulnerability scans (npm audit, Snyk) and SAST tools (Semgrep) in CI.
  - Apply principle of least privilege to any service account or DB user used by payment services.

Checks to perform before production release
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET set in production secrets manager and webhook signature verification implemented
- HTTPS enforced on PUBLIC_ORIGIN and API_ORIGIN
- Rate limiting and basic WAF or API gateway configured
- Monitoring and alerting configured for payment flows
- Idempotency implemented for webhook handler
- SAST and dependency scans pass with no critical findings
- Key rotation policy defined and access limited

Acceptance criteria
- Payment flows complete successfully in sandbox and live mode with webhooks verified
- No sensitive keys or secrets are present in the repository history or code
- Alerts and dashboards provide actionable insights for payment errors
